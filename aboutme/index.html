              Basketball - I am a huge sports fan, but basketball is by far my favorite. I've been
              a Chicago Bulls fan since 2011 and continue rooting them on to this day, even when they
              are really bad.

              Video games - As a computer science major, its only right that I also find entertainment
              from computers as well in the form of video games. My first console was a nintendo wii
              and from that point on I've been a "gamer". I enjoy platformers and I am unstoppable
              at Mario Kart. Do not ask to play any FPS game with me, I am terrible at those.

          I have two loving parents, 2 sisters that drive me absolutely insane, and a massive dog
          named Bentley. My father goes by Steve and loves sports just like me. My moms name is
          Laureen and she is the most caring mother you could ask for, and she loves hosting family
          events. My two sisters, Stephanie and Paige, are the same age as me, making me a triplet.
          They are both at college studying biology and art.
