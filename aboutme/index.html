              Basketball - I am a huge sports fan, but basketball is by far my favorite. I've been
              a Chicago Bulls fan since 2011 and continue rooting them on to this day, even when they
              are really bad.

              Video games - As a computer science major, its only right that I also find entertainment
              from computers as well in the form of video games. My first console was a nintendo wii
              and from that point on I've been a "gamer". I enjoy platformers and I am unstoppable
              at Mario Kart. Do not ask to play any FPS game with me, I am terrible at those.
